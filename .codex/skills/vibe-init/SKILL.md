# vibe-init for Codex

This repository keeps provider-neutral skill runbooks under `.claude/skills`.

When this skill is invoked in Codex, open and follow:

`../../../.claude/skills/vibe-init/SKILL.md`

Codex notes:

- If `docs/context/product.md` or `.vibe/agent/sprint-status.json` is missing, empty, malformed, or still describes the `vibe-doctor` template, treat this skill as the only allowed workflow before any product or harness maintenance work.
- Treat Claude-specific UI references as references to the active agent session unless the source explicitly describes Claude-only behavior.
- When the source skill tells the agent to run `npm run vibe:init`, run `npm run vibe:init -- --from-agent-skill`.
- Keep `.vibe/agent/handoff.md` and `.vibe/agent/session-log.md` current when the source skill requires context persistence.
